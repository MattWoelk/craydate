# Fonts

This is a collection of Playdate fonts suitable for use in "pixelated" games, like those that use the 2X display scale.

- Mini Sans: A sans-serif proportional font, useful for body text.
- Mini Mono: A sans-serif monospace font, useful for more authentically retro body text.
- Nano Sans: A sans-serif proportional font, useful for small captions. Try using it in ALL CAPS.

## Using

Add a `fnt` file and its associated image table to your project, or just a font's whole folder. Use the Playdate SDK's font APIs to use them.

There are both regular and 2X versions of every font. The 2X versions are identical, just twice as large. While the naming may be somewhat confusing, you should use the regular fonts if you're setting the 2x Playdate display scale, and the 2X fonts if you're using the normal 1x Playdate display scale.

You may credit me (Donald Hays / Dovuro) if you wish, but there's no obligation to do so. Use and modify these fonts as you see fit.

## Finally

The non-text graphics in `Preview.gif` and `Preview 2.gif` sample images came from the Kenney 1-bit Platformer Pack, available at https://www.kenney.nl/assets/bit-platformer-pack
