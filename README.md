# How to Run

open this whole thing in VS Code

Terminal -> Run Task...

* craydate-project build tools
* simulator (dev): cargo build
* simulator (dev): make pdx
* simulator (dev): run simulator <-- can probably just run this one, as it has the others as dependencies (can be set to default build task, then run with ctrl+shift+B)
